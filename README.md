## Known Bugs or Issues

So far there are no known bugs once I commented out the intentional bugs added in step 4.

## Experience

The project wasn't bad at all, in fact it was good proactice in using codespaces and onyx. I had to add some code to get the debugger working but beyond that it was an easy project to follow.
